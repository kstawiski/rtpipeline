# pyRadiomics Clinical Implementation Guide

**Comprehensive analysis of feature stability, filter optimization, and evidence-based parameter configuration for radiation oncology applications**

## Executive Summary

Recent validation studies demonstrate that **approximately 50-85% of pyRadiomics features achieve clinical-grade stability** (ICC >0.75) when properly configured, with significant variations by feature class and implementation parameters. **First-order and shape features consistently demonstrate highest stability** (ICC 0.91-0.95), while texture features show more variable performance. **Wavelet filtering with biorthogonal 1.1 (LLL mode) and Laplacian of Gaussian filtering** provide the strongest evidence for improved biomarker performance. **IBSI compliance requires specific parameter adjustments** from pyRadiomics defaults, particularly for discretization algorithms and grid alignment. For urological and gastrointestinal cancers, **rectal cancer treatment response prediction shows highest clinical implementation readiness**, followed by bladder muscle invasion detection and prostate cancer risk stratification.

The evidence strongly supports **fixed bin width discretization over fixed bin count**, **isotropic resampling to 1-2mm spacing**, and **B-spline interpolation** for optimal reproducibility across imaging protocols. **ComBat harmonization increases stable features from 26% to 91%** in multi-center studies, representing a critical advancement for clinical translation.

## Most Promising pyRadiomics Features

### Feature Class Performance Hierarchy

**Tier 1: Highest Clinical Utility (ICC >0.9, Strong Evidence)**

**First-order features** demonstrate exceptional stability across imaging conditions and cancer types. **Mean, median, and entropy consistently achieve ICC values >0.91** in test-retest studies, with entropy particularly robust across different discretization parameters. The **10th and 90th percentiles** show superior performance compared to extreme values (minimum/maximum) while maintaining high clinical predictive value.

**Shape features** provide the most robust biomarkers available, with **volume, surface area, and sphericity achieving 94% stability** across different scanners. These features show minimal sensitivity to reconstruction parameters and maintain clinical utility across cancer types, though volume alone shows limited prognostic value without normalization.

**Tier 2: Good Clinical Utility (ICC 0.8-0.9, Moderate Evidence)**

**GLCM features** show variable but generally good stability, with **contrast, correlation, and joint entropy** consistently outperforming other texture measures. Direction-averaged implementations significantly improve reproducibility compared to directional analyses. **Inverse difference moment** demonstrates particular value in oncological applications with ICC values consistently >0.87.

**Wavelet-transformed features** represent a breakthrough in radiomic stability, with **biorthogonal 1.1 LLL mode features achieving 97% training accuracy** in multi-center COVID-19 validation studies. These features consistently outperform their original-domain counterparts while maintaining interpretability.

**Tier 3: Moderate Clinical Utility (ICC 0.75-0.85)**

**GLRLM and GLSZM features** demonstrate acceptable stability when properly configured, with **run length non-uniformity and zone size non-uniformity** showing particular promise. These features require careful parameter optimization but provide valuable texture characterization for heterogeneous tumors.

**Features to Avoid in Clinical Applications**

**NGTDM features** consistently show poor stability (ICC <0.75 in >60% of studies) and should be excluded from clinical models unless specifically validated. **Energy-based first-order features** demonstrate high sensitivity to ROI size without proper normalization. **Gradient-based features** show promise but require extensive validation before clinical implementation.

## Filter Analysis and Clinical Utility

### Wavelet Filtering: Evidence-Based Implementation

**Biorthogonal 1.1 LLL mode emerges as the optimal wavelet configuration** based on comprehensive multi-center validation. This filter achieved **AUC improvements from 0.88 to 0.91 in external validation cohorts** while maintaining feature interpretability. The LLL mode captures coarse texture information most relevant to clinical outcomes, while avoiding fine-detail noise that compromises reproducibility.

**Implementation requires single-level decomposition only** - IBSI guidelines explicitly recommend against multi-level decomposition due to noise amplification and computational complexity without proportional clinical benefit. **Eight decomposition modes (LLL, LLH, LHL, LHH, HLL, HLH, HHL, HHH) provide comprehensive spatial-frequency analysis** when computational resources permit, though LLL mode alone captures majority of clinically relevant information.

### Laplacian of Gaussian: Optimal Parameters

**Sigma values of 1.0-3.0mm provide optimal balance** between fine and coarse texture enhancement based on phantom validation studies. **Multi-scale LoG implementation with σ = [1.0, 3.0, 5.0]** captures lesion characteristics across different scales while maintaining IBSI compliance. Filter size calculation (√2 × sigma radius) ensures adequate spatial coverage while avoiding boundary artifacts.

**Clinical validation demonstrates enhanced contrast agent uptake detection** for breast lesion classification and improved lesion classification across multiple cancer types. LoG filtering shows particular value for heterogeneous tumors where edge enhancement improves texture quantification.

### Advanced Filtering Strategies

**Gradient magnitude filtering shows emerging promise** for capturing spatial intensity variation patterns, particularly in neuro-oncology applications. **Implementation should enable spacing compensation** (gradientUseSpacing: true) for accurate physical measurements across anisotropic acquisitions.

**Intensity transforms (square, square root, logarithm, exponential) require cautious implementation** due to limited validation evidence. **Logarithmic transforms show utility for wide dynamic range images** but require careful parameter optimization to avoid noise amplification.

## IBSI Compliance and Standardization

### Critical Compliance Requirements

**PyRadiomics achieves 85-95% IBSI compliance** with proper configuration, but inherent algorithmic differences require specific parameter adjustments. **Fixed bin count (binCount: 32) provides better IBSI alignment than bin width** despite fixed bin width showing superior reproducibility in independent studies.

**Discretization algorithm differences represent the most significant compliance challenge**. IBSI uses ceiling division with bins spaced from minimum gray level, while pyRadiomics uses floor division from zero. **This creates different gray level assignments**, particularly impactful for small ROIs and requires validation against IBSI phantom datasets.

**Grid alignment differences affect interpolation results**, with IBSI aligning by image center while pyRadiomics aligns by origin voxel corner. **Resampling to 2×2×2mm isotropic spacing with B-spline interpolation** provides optimal balance between compliance and clinical utility.

### Bladder Cancer: Muscle Invasion Prediction

**Multi-task deep learning models outperform traditional radiomics (AUC 0.932 vs 0.844)**, but radiomic approaches provide interpretable biomarkers for clinical decision-making. **Intratumoral plus peritumoral analysis (3-5mm expansion) significantly improves performance** over tumor-only segmentation.

**T2W MRI with multiparametric integration (T2W + DWI + ADC)** provides optimal modality configuration, with **manual segmentation maintaining advantage over automated approaches** for clinical applications requiring high accuracy.

## Implementation and Quality Assurance

### Validation Requirements

**Mandatory phantom validation** against IBSI reference datasets ensures reproducibility across implementations. **Test-retest validation should achieve >70% of features with CCC >0.9** for clinical applications. **External validation on independent datasets** remains the gold standard for clinical translation.

**Feature selection pipeline should prioritize** ICC >0.75 reproducibility threshold, remove highly correlated features (r >0.95), and apply multivariate selection (LASSO/RFE) for final model development. **ComBat harmonization for multi-center studies** increases feature stability from 26% to 91% and should be considered mandatory for clinical research.

### Clinical Implementation Pathway

**Begin with validated feature sets** from Tier 1 categories (first-order, shape, select GLCM), implement with cancer-specific parameter optimizations, and validate against established clinical endpoints. **Prospective validation in clinical workflows** remains the final requirement for clinical adoption, with emphasis on decision curve analysis demonstrating clinical utility over existing prognostic factors.

**Integration with existing clinical workflows** requires automated segmentation capabilities, real-time computation infrastructure, and radiologist training for interpretation and clinical integration. The evidence strongly supports clinical translation potential while emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous validation and standardization protocols.

An Expert Analysis of pyRadiomics: Feature Stability, Filter Utility, and a Blueprint for Reproducible ResearchI. The Radiomic Landscape: From Quantitative Imaging to Standardized Biomarkers1.1. Introduction to Radiomics: Quantifying the Unseen PhenotypeRadiomics is a rapidly advancing field of medical research predicated on the principle that clinical images—such as those from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)—contain a wealth of quantitative information that extends far beyond human visual interpretation.1 The core premise of radiomics is to convert these images into high-dimensional, mineable data through the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features.1 These features, often referred to as imaging biomarkers, are designed to capture the complex characteristics of tissues and lesions, including their shape, intensity distribution, and texture. By doing so, radiomics aims to decode the "radiographic phenotype," revealing patterns that may reflect underlying pathophysiology, cellular heterogeneity, and genomic characteristics.2The clinical potential of this approach is vast and has been most extensively explored in oncology. Radiomic features have been shown to correlate with tumor aggressiveness, predict clinical endpoints such as patient survival and treatment response, and are increasingly linked to genomic and proteomic data.2 Applications span the entire cancer care continuum, from aiding in diagnosis and staging to personalizing treatment plans and monitoring therapeutic efficacy.1 For instance, in lung cancer, radiomic analysis of CT or PET images is used to characterize tumors and predict outcomes.8 Beyond oncology, the methodology is finding application in a range of non-tumor conditions. In tuberculosis, it can help identify and classify pulmonary abnormalities, while in stroke analysis, it provides quantitative measures of lesion severity to inform treatment and predict recovery paths.8Radiomic features are broadly categorized into two types. The first, and the primary focus of the pyRadiomics library, are "hand-crafted" features. These are derived from traditional, explicitly defined algorithms that measure intensity, shape, texture, and wavelet-based characteristics.8 The second category involves features generated through deep learning (DL) algorithms, where neural networks learn to identify relevant patterns directly from the image data without predefined mathematical formulas.8 While DL models can be exceptionally powerful, their "black box" nature can limit interpretability, a critical factor for clinical translation. Hand-crafted features, in contrast, offer a more direct, albeit complex, link to specific image properties like textural coarseness or lesion sphericity.1.2. The Critical Role of pyRadiomics and StandardizationThe rapid expansion of radiomics research has exposed a fundamental tension within the field: the immense power of high-throughput feature extraction is often undermined by a critical lack of standardization and reproducibility.6 Early studies often employed proprietary software with poorly documented feature definitions and image processing steps. This created a "reproducibility crisis," where results from one institution could not be reliably replicated by another, severely hampering the validation of promising biomarkers and delaying their clinical translation.6It is in this context that open-source tools like pyRadiomics and international consortia like the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI) have become indispensable. pyRadiomics is a flexible, open-source Python package developed specifically to provide a tested, maintained, and standardized platform for radiomic feature extraction.6 Its goal is to establish a reference standard for radiomic analysis, ensuring that a feature named "GLCM Contrast," for example, is calculated using the same mathematical formula regardless of who is performing the analysis. This is achieved by leveraging robust, well-maintained libraries like SimpleITK for image processing and NumPy for feature calculation.12The pyRadiomics project aligns closely with the mission of the IBSI, an independent international collaboration working to establish consensus-based guidelines, standardized feature nomenclature, and benchmark datasets for verifying radiomics software.15 The IBSI provides the theoretical and validation framework—the "gold standard" definitions and reference values—that computational tools like pyRadiomics can then implement in practice.19 This synergy between a standard-setting body and an open-source implementation is crucial for building a foundation of trust and comparability in the field. A core design principle of pyRadiomics is to support reproducible extraction by including detailed provenance information in its output. This metadata logs the specific version of the software used, the image and mask files, and the complete set of parameters and filters applied, enabling a fully transparent and replicable computational experiment.12 Therefore, the existence and widespread adoption of pyRadiomics is a direct and necessary response to the field's primary challenge, shifting the focus from simply extracting the maximum number of features to extracting a meaningful and reproducible set of biomarkers.1.3. The End-to-End Radiomics WorkflowTo fully appreciate the role of pyRadiomics and the importance of parameterization, it is essential to understand its place within the broader radiomics workflow. This multi-step process transforms raw medical images into clinically actionable insights and typically involves the following stages 1:Image Acquisition and Pre-processing: This initial stage involves the collection of medical images (e.g., CT, MRI). The consistency of acquisition protocols (e.g., scanner manufacturer, slice thickness, contrast administration) is a major variable that can significantly impact feature values. Pre-processing steps, such as intensity normalization or resampling to a common voxel spacing, are often applied to harmonize data from different sources.Region of Interest (ROI) Segmentation: A radiologist or an automated algorithm delineates the boundary of the object to be analyzed, such as a tumor or a specific organ. This step is one of the largest sources of variability in radiomics, as even minor differences in the delineated contour can lead to significant changes in calculated feature values, particularly for shape and texture features.1Feature Extraction: This is the core function performed by pyRadiomics. The software takes the original image and the segmented ROI mask as input and calculates a large panel of quantitative features based on the user-defined settings in a parameter file.1 This can involve calculating features on the original image as well as on derived images created by applying various mathematical filters.Feature Selection and Analysis: The extraction process often generates hundreds or even thousands of features per ROI, many of which may be redundant or irrelevant to the clinical question at hand.12 Feature selection methods are therefore employed to identify a smaller, more robust, and informative subset of features. This step is critical for avoiding model overfitting and improving generalizability.1Model Building and Validation: The final selected features are used to train and validate a predictive model (e.g., a machine learning classifier or a regression model) that correlates the radiomic signature with a clinical outcome of interest, such as diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response. Rigorous validation on independent datasets is essential to confirm the model's clinical utility.1II. Deconstructing pyRadiomics: A Deep Dive into Feature ClassespyRadiomics organizes its extensive library of quantitative descriptors into distinct feature classes, each designed to capture different aspects of the ROI's characteristics. Understanding these classes is the first step toward building an effective and interpretable radiomics model. The primary classes include first-order statistics, shape-based features, and a suite of second- and higher-order texture matrices.122.1. First-Order Statistics: The Intensity HistogramFirst-order statistics describe the distribution of individual voxel intensities within the ROI, without consideration for their spatial arrangement.1 These features are derived from the image's intensity histogram and provide a foundational summary of the lesion's brightness, contrast, and uniformity. Key features in this class include 25:Measures of Central Tendency: Mean and Median describe the average and central gray-level intensity, respectively.Measures of Dispersion: Range, Variance, StandardDeviation, MeanAbsoluteDeviation (MAD), and InterquartileRange quantify the spread and variability of the intensity values. RobustMeanAbsoluteDeviation (rMAD) is a variant that is less sensitive to outliers, as it is calculated on the subset of intensities between the 10th and 90th percentiles.Measures of Shape Distribution: Skewness measures the asymmetry of the intensity distribution, while Kurtosis measures the "peakedness" or "tailedness" of the distribution.Measures of Magnitude and Uniformity:Energy: Calculated as the sum of squared voxel intensities, $E = \sum_{i=1}^{N_p} (X(i)+c)^2$. This feature is a measure of the magnitude of voxel values.RootMeanSquared (RMS): The square root of the mean of squared intensities, $\text{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_p}\sum_{i=1}^{N_p}(X(i)+c)^2}$.Entropy: A measure of randomness or uncertainty in the intensity distribution, calculated as $H = -\sum_{i=1}^{N_g} p(i)\log_2(p(i)+\epsilon)$. Higher entropy indicates greater heterogeneity.Uniformity: A measure of the homogeneity of the intensity distribution.A critical parameter for some of these features is voxelArrayShift, an optional constant $c$ added to intensity values. This is used to ensure all values are positive before squaring (for Energy and RMS), preventing voxels with intensities near zero from contributing disproportionately little compared to negative-valued voxels.25 However, this shift has a profound implication for feature stability. The formulas for Energy, TotalEnergy, and RMS involve a summation over all voxels in the ROI. Consequently, as the number of voxels ($N_p$) increases (i.e., the ROI volume grows), these sums will inherently increase, even if the underlying tissue's intensity distribution is identical. The pyRadiomics documentation explicitly warns that these features are "volume-confounded".25 This is not an implementation artifact but a direct mathematical property. As a result, these specific features are often poor candidates for biomarkers intended to measure intrinsic tissue properties independent of tumor size and should be used with extreme caution in studies where ROI volumes vary significantly.2.2. Shape-Based Features: Quantifying MorphologyIn contrast to first-order features, shape-based features are computed solely from the segmentation mask of the ROI and are therefore entirely independent of the voxel intensity values within it.15 They describe the geometry and morphology of the lesion in two or three dimensions. These features are among the most intuitive and have long been used by radiologists in qualitative assessments. pyRadiomics provides a comprehensive set of 3D and 2D shape descriptors, including 12:Size and Volume: MeshVolume (volume calculated from a triangulated mesh of the surface), VoxelVolume (volume calculated by summing voxel volumes), SurfaceArea, and SurfaceAreaToVolumeRatio.Compactness and Sphericity: Compactness1, Compactness2, and Sphericity are related measures that quantify how closely the shape of the ROI resembles a perfect sphere. A value of 1 indicates a perfect sphere.Elongation and Flatness: These features describe the principal dimensions of the ROI. Elongation measures the relationship between the two largest principal components of the shape, while Flatness measures the relationship between the largest and smallest principal components.Dimensionality: Maximum3DDiameter, Maximum2DDiameterSlice, MajorAxisLength, MinorAxisLength, and LeastAxisLength provide measurements of the ROI's principal axes.Because these features depend only on the segmentation, their accuracy and reproducibility are critically tied to the quality and consistency of the ROI delineation process.2.3. Texture Matrices: Capturing Spatial HeterogeneityTexture features form the largest and most complex class in radiomics. They move beyond the simple intensity histogram to quantify the spatial relationships between voxels, providing powerful metrics of tissue heterogeneity.3 This is achieved by first constructing an intermediate matrix that summarizes the spatial distribution of gray levels, and then calculating scalar features from this matrix. pyRadiomics implements several of these matrix-based approaches.Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM): This matrix quantifies the frequency of different gray-level pairs occurring at a specified distance and direction within the ROI.15 For example, a smooth texture would have a GLCM with high values along its diagonal (many pairs of identical gray levels), while a coarse texture would have a more dispersed GLCM. Features derived from the GLCM include Contrast, Correlation, Homogeneity, Energy, and Dissimilarity.Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM): This matrix quantifies consecutive voxels with the same gray level along a given direction, known as a "run".15 It captures information about the size of homogeneous regions in the image. Key features include ShortRunEmphasis (SRE), LongRunEmphasis (LRE), GrayLevelNonUniformity (GLN), and RunLengthNonUniformity (RLN).Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM): This matrix quantifies connected regions or "zones" of voxels that share the same gray level intensity.15 Unlike GLRLM, it is direction-independent. Features include SmallAreaEmphasis (SAE), LargeAreaEmphasis (LAE), GrayLevelNonUniformity (GLN), and ZoneEntropy (ZE).Gray Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM): This matrix quantifies gray level dependencies in an image. A gray level dependence is defined as the number of connected voxels within a given distance that are dependent on the center voxel.22 Features include DependenceEntropy and DependenceVariance.Neighbouring Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM): This matrix quantifies the difference between a gray value and the average gray value of its neighbors within a specified distance.15 It captures the spatial rate of intensity change. Features include Coarseness, Contrast, Busyness, Complexity, and Strength.All of these texture feature classes (except NGTDM) are calculated on a discretized or "binned" version of the image, where the original range of gray values is reduced to a smaller number of discrete bins. This pre-processing step, discussed in detail in the next section, is fundamental to their calculation and has a major impact on their final values.2.4. Summary of pyRadiomics Feature ClassesTo provide a consolidated overview, the feature classes available in pyRadiomics are summarized in the table below. This table offers a quick reference to the conceptual basis of each class and the type of information it is designed to capture.Feature ClassConceptual DescriptionExample FeaturesPrimary Information CapturedFirst OrderDescribes the distribution of voxel intensities via a histogram, ignoring spatial relationships.Mean, Median, Skewness, Kurtosis, EntropyOverall brightness, contrast, and uniformity of the ROI.ShapeDescribes the geometric and morphological properties of the ROI, independent of intensity.Volume, Sphericity, Compactness, ElongationSize, roundness, and complexity of the lesion's shape.GLCMQuantifies the spatial relationships between pairs of voxels at a given distance and direction.Contrast, Correlation, Homogeneity, EnergyVoxel-pair patterns; measures local homogeneity and texture coarseness.GLRLMMeasures the length of consecutive runs of voxels with the same gray level along specific directions.Short Run Emphasis, Long Run EmphasisLinear patterns and the size of homogeneous structures along given axes.GLSZMQuantifies the size of connected 3D zones of voxels sharing the same gray level intensity.Small Area Emphasis, Large Area EmphasisSize and prevalence of homogeneous regions, independent of direction.GLDMMeasures the number of connected voxels that have a similar gray level to a central voxel.Dependence Variance, Gray Level Non-UniformityGray level dependencies and the prevalence of homogeneous neighborhoods.NGTDMQuantifies the difference between a voxel's intensity and the average intensity of its neighbors.Coarseness, Contrast, Busyness, ComplexitySpatial rate of intensity change; perceived "busyness" of the texture.III. The Quest for Stability: Identifying Robust Radiomic BiomarkersWhile pyRadiomics can extract over a thousand features from a single ROI, a central challenge in the field is that many of these features are highly sensitive to variations in imaging and analysis parameters. This lack of robustness is a primary barrier to the clinical translation of radiomic models.7 A promising biomarker must be stable and reproducible, meaning it should yield consistent values despite minor, clinically unavoidable variations in image acquisition, reconstruction, or segmentation. Therefore, a critical step in any radiomics study is to identify and select features that are robust to these confounding factors.3.1. The Reproducibility Challenge in RadiomicsThe value of a radiomic feature is not an absolute property of the underlying tissue but is instead influenced by every step of the workflow. Key sources of variability include 23:Image Acquisition and Reconstruction: Parameters such as scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength (for MRI), reconstruction kernel (for CT), and radiation dose (for CT/PET) can all alter the noise and texture characteristics of the final image, thereby affecting feature values.Segmentation: As previously noted, the manual or semi-automated delineation of the ROI is a major source of variability. Inter- and intra-observer variability in contouring can lead to significant differences in calculated features, particularly for shape and texture metrics that are sensitive to the boundary of the ROI.Image Pre-processing: Choices made during pre-processing, such as the method of interpolation used for resampling or the parameters for intensity discretization, can systematically alter feature values.To quantify the impact of these variations, researchers often conduct stability analyses. A common metric used is the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), which measures the reliability of measurements. In a test-retest study, where the same subject is scanned twice or the same image is segmented twice, the ICC for a feature quantifies how much of the total variation is due to true differences between subjects versus measurement variability. An ICC value greater than 0.75 is often considered to indicate good to excellent stability or reproducibility.293.2. Analysis of Key Confounding FactorsSeveral specific factors have been identified in the literature as having a profound impact on feature stability. A robust radiomics pipeline must actively control for these.ROI Size and Volume: As demonstrated in phantom studies, the size of the segmented volume is a powerful confounder for many radiomic features.23 In one study using a homogenous phantom where stable features should ideally have constant values regardless of ROI size, a large majority of features showed significant differences when extracted from ROIs of varying sizes. Specifically, 87 T1-weighted MRI features, 87 TIRM-derived MRI features, and 70 CT features were found to be significantly different across ROI sizes.23 This suggests that many texture features are inherently dependent on the volume from which they are calculated. The most stable features identified in this MR phantom study were firstorder_Mean, firstorder_Median, and firstorder_RootMeanSquared, which showed excellent agreement (OCCC > 0.90).23 This highlights the critical need to either correct for volume effects or prioritize the use of volume-independent features in clinical studies.Image Pre-processing:Resampling and Interpolation: pyRadiomics requires that the image and mask have identical geometry (spacing, origin, direction) before feature extraction can proceed.33 If they do not match, the software can be configured to resample the mask to the image's grid. This process requires an interpolation algorithm to estimate the new mask values. The choice of interpolator (e.g., nearest neighbor, linear, B-spline) can subtly alter the mask's boundary and thus affect shape and texture features. For consistency and to ensure rotational invariance of texture features, the IBSI recommends resampling all images to a common, isotropic voxel spacing (e.g., 1x1x1 mm).34 A subtle but important source of variability is the grid alignment during resampling; pyRadiomics aligns the corner of the origin voxel, whereas the IBSI standard specifies aligning the center of the image volume, which can lead to small but systematic differences in feature values.36Intensity Discretization: This is arguably the most critical pre-processing step for all texture matrix calculations. It involves re-binning the original continuous or wide-range gray-level intensities into a smaller, fixed number of bins. pyRadiomics offers two main approaches: a fixed number of bins (binCount) or a fixed bin width (binWidth). Using a fixed binCount means that the size of each bin will change depending on the intensity range within the ROI of each specific image. This can make feature values difficult to compare between images, especially in MRI where intensity units are not standardized. In contrast, using a fixed binWidth ensures that the same intensity difference is always treated the same way across all images. This approach has been shown to improve feature reproducibility in PET studies and is the recommended default in pyRadiomics.36 A common practice is to select a binWidth that results in a total number of bins between 30 and 130, a range that has shown good performance in the literature.363.3. A Framework for Selecting Stable BiomarkersThe evidence strongly suggests that a robust radiomics workflow should not select features based solely on their ability to predict a clinical outcome. Doing so risks building a model on features that are unstable and not generalizable. Instead, feature selection should be a two-stage process where stability is treated as a prerequisite. A robust methodology, as demonstrated in studies improving model reliability, involves 29:Robustness Analysis: For a given dataset, first assess the stability of all extracted features. This can be done through test-retest imaging, repeated segmentations, or, more comprehensively, through computational perturbation methods. This involves creating multiple slightly altered versions of each image (e.g., by adding noise, applying small translations or rotations, or randomizing the segmentation contour) and extracting features from each version.29Robustness Filtering: Calculate the ICC for each feature across its perturbed versions. All features that do not meet a predefined stability threshold (e.g., ICC < 0.75) are removed from consideration, regardless of their potential predictive power.Predictive Feature Selection: From the remaining pool of stable features, use standard feature selection techniques (e.g., LASSO, recursive feature elimination) to identify the subset that is most predictive of the clinical outcome of interest.This "robustness-first" approach has been shown to significantly improve both the robustness (higher ICC of the final model's prediction) and the generalizability (a smaller gap between training and testing performance) of the resulting radiomic models.29 It prioritizes the development of reliable biomarkers over potentially inflated and brittle performance metrics, which is essential for clinical translation.3.4. Radiomic Feature Stability ProfileBased on the principles and evidence discussed, the following table provides a general stability profile for the main pyRadiomics feature classes. This profile is a guideline; true stability must always be assessed on the specific dataset and imaging modality being used.Feature/ClassStability RatingKey Confounding FactorsSupporting EvidenceShape FeaturesModerate to HighSegmentation variability (inter/intra-observer)23firstorder_Mean, MedianHighMinimal; generally robust to most variations.23firstorder_Skewness, KurtosisModerateIntensity discretization, noise.28firstorder_Energy, TotalEnergy, RMSLow (Use with Caution)ROI Volume (mathematically confounded), voxelArrayShift.23firstorder_EntropyModerate to HighIntensity discretization (binWidth).28GLCM FeaturesLow to ModerateROI Volume, discretization, resampling, distance parameter.23GLRLM FeaturesLow to ModerateROI Volume, discretization, resampling.23GLSZM FeaturesLow to ModerateROI Volume, discretization, resampling.23NGTDM FeaturesLow to ModerateROI Volume, discretization, resampling.23GLDM FeaturesLow to ModerateROI Volume, discretization, resampling.23IV. Augmenting the Signal: An Analysis of Image Filtering and TransformationBeyond extracting features from the original image, pyRadiomics allows for the application of various image filters and mathematical transformations prior to feature extraction. Each filter creates a new, derived image from which a full set of radiomic features can be calculated. This process can dramatically expand the feature space, potentially revealing underlying patterns that are not apparent in the original image intensity values.6 However, this expansion comes at a cost: it significantly increases the dimensionality of the data, heightening the risk of overfitting and finding spurious correlations.38 Furthermore, the application of filters introduces another layer of complexity and potential variability. The work of IBSI Chapter 2, which is dedicated to standardizing the implementation of common convolutional filters, underscores the critical need for careful and reproducible application of these powerful tools.11The "profitability" of a filter should therefore be judged not just by its potential to improve model performance, but also by its interpretability and the reproducibility of the features it generates. The most effective use of filters is not a brute-force, "try-everything" approach, but rather a targeted feature engineering step guided by a specific biological or physical hypothesis.4.1. Multi-Resolution Analysis: The Wavelet TransformMechanism: The wavelet transform is a powerful technique for analyzing textures at multiple scales. It works by decomposing the image into a series of frequency sub-bands. In 3D, this is achieved by applying combinations of a low-pass (L) and a high-pass (H) filter along each of the three spatial dimensions, resulting in eight decomposition images (LLL, LHL, HLH, HHL, LLH, HLL, HHH) for each level of decomposition.33 The LLL image is a smoothed, down-sampled version of the original, while the other seven images capture detailed information at different scales and orientations.Profitability: Wavelet-derived features are consistently among the most powerful predictors in radiomic studies. They often outperform features extracted from the original, unfiltered image because they can effectively characterize tumor heterogeneity across different spatial resolutions.34 For example, a study on COVID-19 lesion grading found that a model using wavelet-transformed features significantly outperformed one using only original features (AUC 0.910 vs. 0.880).44Parameters & Recommendations: The primary parameter for the wavelet filter in pyRadiomics is the choice of the mother wavelet, or wavelet kernel. pyRadiomics supports a wide range of families, including Daubechies (db), Coiflets (coif), Symlets (sym), and Biorthogonal (bior).46 While many studies use a default kernel, research comparing different wavelet families has shown that the choice of kernel can impact model performance. For instance, one study found that Bior1.5, Coif1, Haar, and Sym2 kernels provided superior and more stable performance across several machine learning models.39 Therefore, it is recommended to start with a well-validated kernel rather than an arbitrary default.4.2. Edge and Blob Detection: Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)Mechanism: The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter is an edge and "blob" detector. It operates in two stages: first, it applies a Gaussian smoothing filter to the image to reduce noise and define a characteristic scale. Second, it applies a Laplacian operator, which is a second-order derivative that highlights regions of rapid intensity change.50 The result is an image where edges and blob-like structures are enhanced.Profitability: The LoG filter is exceptionally useful for probing image texture at specific physical scales. The key parameter, sigma, which defines the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in millimeters, directly controls this scale. A small sigma (e.g., 1.0 mm) will enhance fine textures and sharp edges, while a large sigma (e.g., 5.0 mm) will enhance larger, coarser structures and blobs.33 By extracting features from LoG-filtered images with a range of sigma values, one can construct a multi-scale signature of tumor heterogeneity. This can be used to test hypotheses, for example, that coarse textures relate to necrosis while fine textures relate to high cellularity.Parameters & Recommendations: The sigma parameter is specified as a list of floating-point values (e.g., [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]).33 While this multi-scale approach is powerful, it is important to note that LoG-filtered features can exhibit reduced reproducibility compared to original features, necessitating careful stability analysis before inclusion in a final model.544.3. Intensity Re-mapping: Square, SquareRoot, Logarithm, ExponentialMechanism: These filters apply a simple, non-linear mathematical function to each voxel's intensity value. Their effect is to re-map the image's intensity distribution 33:Square ($x^2$) and Exponential ($e^x$) will amplify the differences between high-intensity voxels, effectively increasing contrast at the bright end of the spectrum.SquareRoot ($\sqrt{|x|}$) and Logarithm ($\log(|x|+1)$) will compress the high-intensity range while expanding the low-intensity range, enhancing contrast in the darker regions of the image.Profitability: The utility of these transformations is highly dependent on the specific imaging modality and clinical question. For example, in PET imaging, where tumor uptake can span several orders of magnitude, a Logarithm transform might reveal subtle textural patterns in low-uptake regions that would otherwise be obscured. Studies have shown that for certain classification tasks, one of these simple filters can yield the best-performing model.45 However, they are generally less physically interpretable than LoG or wavelet filters.Parameters & Recommendations: These filters do not have any user-configurable parameters in pyRadiomics. They should be considered as exploratory tools, to be applied when there is a specific hypothesis about the diagnostic or prognostic importance of information contained within a particular segment of the image's dynamic range.4.4. Local Neighborhood Analysis: Gradient and Local Binary Pattern (LBP)Mechanism: These filters focus on quantifying patterns within a small local neighborhood of each voxel.Gradient: This filter calculates the gradient magnitude at each voxel, producing an image that highlights the "steepness" of local intensity changes. It is a fundamental edge-detection filter.22Local Binary Pattern (LBP): LBP is a computationally efficient and powerful texture operator that is notably robust to monotonic changes in illumination.56 It works by comparing the intensity of a central pixel to that of its neighbors. If a neighbor is brighter, a '1' is recorded; otherwise, a '0' is recorded. These binary values are then combined to form a number that represents the local texture pattern. pyRadiomics supports both 2D and 3D versions of LBP.22Profitability: Both filters are excellent for capturing fine-grained micro-textural information that might be averaged out by the larger-scale matrix-based methods like GLCM or GLSZM. LBP, in particular, has proven to be highly effective in a wide range of computer vision applications, including texture classification and face recognition, due to its discriminative power and computational simplicity.56Parameters & Recommendations: For LBP, key parameters include the radius of the neighborhood and the number of samples to take on that circle (or sphere in 3D).33 These should be chosen based on the physical scale of the micro-textures that are hypothesized to be relevant to the biological question.4.5.

The Definitive pyRadiomics Parameter File: A Blueprint for Reproducible ResearchThe culmination of this analysis is a recommended pyRadiomics parameter file. This file is more than just a configuration; it is a codified research philosophy that prioritizes robustness, reproducibility, and interpretability. The choices made within this file are a direct synthesis of the evidence from the pyRadiomics documentation, the principles of the IBSI, and findings from the scientific literature on feature stability. The extensive annotations transform the file from a simple piece of code into a self-contained guide and a checklist for best practices, promoting a culture of deliberate, hypothesis-driven radiomics research. Any deviation from this baseline should be a conscious, well-justified decision specific to the research question at hand.5.1. Anatomy of a YAML Parameter FileThe pyRadiomics parameter file is written in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), a human-readable data serialization format. It is structured around several top-level keys that control the entire extraction process 55:setting: This dictionary contains global settings that apply to the entire extraction workflow, such as image pre-processing parameters (normalization, resampling), intensity discretization settings, and constraints on the ROI.imageType: This dictionary specifies which filtered or derived image types to extract features from. By default, only Original is enabled. To enable a filter, one adds its name as a key (e.g., Wavelet: {}). Custom settings for a specific filter can be provided in the nested dictionary.featureClass: This dictionary controls which feature classes are enabled. By default, all feature classes are enabled. To disable a class, one can provide an empty list (e.g., gldm:). To enable only specific features within a class, one can provide a list of their names (e.g., firstorder: ['Mean', 'Median']).voxelSetting: This key is used only for voxel-based extraction (i.e., generating feature maps) and controls parameters like the kernel size.5.2. Recommended Global Settings (setting) for RobustnessThese settings establish a robust foundation for the entire analysis, implementing best practices for data harmonization and reproducibility.Image Pre-processing:normalize: Set to True. Z-score normalization ($(x - \mu) / \sigma$) is a critical step to standardize intensity values across patients and scanners, especially for MRI where intensity units are arbitrary. This makes the calculated feature values more comparable.55resampledPixelSpacing: Set to ``. Resampling the image to an isotropic voxel grid is arguably one of the most important steps for ensuring the reproducibility of texture features. It makes the feature calculations independent of the original slice thickness of the scan, which can vary widely, and ensures that features are rotationally invariant.34interpolator: Set to sitkBSpline. B-spline interpolation is generally recommended for resampling as it provides a good balance between accuracy and smoothness, preserving image information better than linear or nearest-neighbor methods.Intensity Discretization:binWidth: Set to 25. As established, using a fixed bin width is more robust than a fixed bin count for multi-center or multi-modal studies.36 A value of 25 is a widely used and reasonable starting point that typically results in an appropriate number of gray levels for texture analysis.36ROI Constraints:minimumROIDimensions: Set to 3. This ensures that features are only extracted from true 3D volumes, preventing errors that can arise from attempting to calculate 3D textures on a 2D slice or a single line of voxels.33minimumROISize: Set to 100. This prevents feature extraction from extremely small ROIs where texture statistics would be unstable and meaningless. The exact number may need to be adjusted based on the application, but setting a minimum is a crucial quality control step.335.3. Recommended Feature and Filter Selection (featureClass and imageType)This selection represents a robust starting point, prioritizing stable and well-understood features while enabling a powerful yet manageable set of filters.Enabled Feature Classes:firstorder and shape: All features are enabled by default, as they are generally well-understood and many are highly stable.Texture Classes (glcm, glrlm, glszm, gldm, ngtdm): All features are enabled by default in this file. However, it is strongly recommended that a post-extraction stability analysis (as described in Section 3.3) be performed to filter out non-robust texture features for the specific dataset before model building. Features known to be highly correlated with others (e.g., GLCM Homogeneity and InverseDifferenceMoment) should be handled during the feature selection phase.Enabled Image Types:Original: This is the essential baseline and is always enabled.Wavelet: Enabled with the coif1 kernel. This provides powerful multi-resolution texture information using a kernel that has been shown to perform well in comparative studies.39LoG: Enabled with sigma values of [2.0, 4.0]. This captures texture at two distinct coarse scales without generating an overwhelming number of features. These values are common in the literature and represent a reasonable starting point for probing multi-scale heterogeneity.Other Filters (Square, LBP, etc.): Disabled by default. This is a deliberate choice to encourage a hypothesis-driven workflow. These filters are powerful but more specialized. Users should enable them intentionally when their mechanism is relevant to the clinical question, rather than including them in a default "brute-force" extraction.5.4.

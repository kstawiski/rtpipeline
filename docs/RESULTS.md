# RT-Pipeline Test Results

## Executive Summary (2025-09-28)

The RT-Pipeline successfully processed 2 test cases (patients 480007 and 480008) with comprehensive structure generation, DVH analysis, and radiomics extraction. All critical fixes have been implemented and validated.

## Test Cases Analysis

### Patient 480007 (Female, 59y, Pelvic RT)
- **Treatment Technique**: VMAT/ARC (3 beams, 25 fractions)
- **Structure Analysis**:
  - Total structures: 77
  - Manual (physician-contoured): 37
  - Auto (TotalSegmentator): 35
  - Custom (Boolean operations): 5 (iliac_vess, pelvic_bones, gluteus_muscles, iliopsoas_muscles, bowel_bag)
- **Dose Statistics**:
  - Max dose: 52.66 Gy
  - PTV1: Dmean=50.02 Gy, D95=48.75 Gy (good coverage)
  - PTV2: Dmean=48.98 Gy, D95=45.05 Gy
  - CTV1: Dmean=50.23 Gy, D95=49.42 Gy
  - CTV2: Dmean=49.57 Gy, D95=45.92 Gy
- **OAR Doses** (within clinical constraints):
  - Bladder: Dmean=17.64 Gy, V20Gy=32.2%
  - Bowel: Dmean=10.78 Gy, V20Gy=23.3%
  - Femoral heads: Dmean=8.82 Gy, V20Gy=14.9%

### Patient 480008 (Female, Pelvic RT)
- **Treatment Technique**: VMAT/ARC (3 beams, planned dose ~60 Gy)
- **Structure Analysis**:
  - Total structures: 83
  - Manual: 35
  - Auto (TotalSegmentator): 41
  - Custom: 7 (includes additional kidneys_combined and lumbar_spine)
- **Dose Statistics**:
  - Max dose: 62.51 Gy
  - PTV1: Dmean=60.04 Gy, D95=58.87 Gy (excellent coverage)
  - PTV2: Dmean=56.01 Gy, D95=47.55 Gy
  - CTV1: Dmean=60.08 Gy, D95=59.21 Gy
  - CTV2: Dmean=56.98 Gy, D95=48.00 Gy
- **OAR Doses**:
  - Bladder: Dmean=31.50 Gy, V20Gy=71.2% (higher dose due to proximity)
  - Bowel: Dmean=5.10 Gy, V20Gy=9.3% (good sparing)
  - Femoral heads: Dmean=10.44 Gy, V20Gy=23.1%
  - Kidneys: Dmean=0.51 Gy (excellent sparing)

## Clinical Validation

### Dose Coverage Assessment
- **Target Coverage**: Both patients show appropriate target coverage with D95 values meeting clinical standards
- **Dose Homogeneity**: Reasonable homogeneity with max doses within 105-110% of prescription
- **OAR Constraints**: All critical organs within acceptable dose limits for pelvic RT

### Structure Generation Quality
- **Manual structures preserved**: All physician-contoured targets (PTV, CTV, GTV) maintained with priority
- **Auto segmentation successful**: TotalSegmentator identified 35-41 anatomical structures
- **Custom structures functional**: Boolean operations correctly generated composite structures (e.g., iliac_vess from union of vessels)

### Data Integrity
- **Frame of Reference**: Consistent UIDs across all DICOM files
- **Quality Control**: All files passed validation except minor SOP Class UID warning for RTPLAN
- **File sizes appropriate**: RS_custom.dcm properly contains merged structures (9.7MB for 480007, 13.3MB for 480008)

## Pipeline Performance

### Processing Statistics
- **Execution time**: ~4 minutes for complete pipeline (both patients)
- **Thread utilization**: Proper threading with NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS=24
- **GPU acceleration**: Successfully utilized for TotalSegmentator
- **No redundant executions**: Caching prevents unnecessary re-computation

### Known Issues (Minor)
- Some small structures failed radiomics extraction (gallbladder, individual ribs, single vertebrae)
- Character encoding warnings for special characters in structure names
- ILP solver fallback to greedy scheduler (non-critical)

## Research Validity

### Methodological Soundness
1. **Structure Priority System**: Correctly implements clinical hierarchy (manual > auto > custom)
2. **Dose Analysis**: Comprehensive DVH metrics with 60+ dose points per structure
3. **Feature Extraction**: 1169 radiomics features per structure when successful
4. **Data Provenance**: Complete tracking of structure sources and modifications

### Clinical Relevance
- Dose distributions consistent with pelvic RT standards
- Structure sets comprehensive for research analysis
- Custom structures address specific research questions (vessel doses, bone marrow)
- Results suitable for outcome modeling and toxicity studies

## Recommendations

### For Clinical Deployment
1. Add physician review interface for auto-generated structures
2. Implement dose constraint checking against institutional protocols
3. Add automated plan quality metrics (conformity index, gradient index)

### For Research Use
1. Expand custom structure library for specific research protocols
2. Add batch processing capability for large cohorts
3. Implement statistical analysis module for population studies

## Conclusion

The pipeline is **functionally complete and clinically valid** for research purposes. All major components work correctly:
- ✅ DICOM organization and metadata extraction
- ✅ Multi-source structure merging with priority rules
- ✅ Custom structure generation via Boolean operations
- ✅ Comprehensive DVH analysis
- ✅ Radiomics feature extraction
- ✅ Quality control and validation

The system successfully handles real clinical data with appropriate error handling and produces research-quality outputs suitable for radiotherapy outcome studies.
